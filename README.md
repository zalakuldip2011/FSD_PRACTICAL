# Full Stack Development Practicals

A collection of four web development practicals demonstrating different technologies and concepts, from basic HTML/CSS/JS to modern React applications.

## Project Overview

This repository contains four distinct web applications, each showcasing different aspects of full-stack development with a consistent, clean design language throughout.

## Practicals Summary

### 📊 [Practical 1 - Real-time Voting System](./Practical_1/)
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Features**: Real-time voting, automatic updates, clean UI
- **Concepts**: DOM manipulation, timers, event handling

### 🌤️ [Practical 2 - Simple Weather App](./Practical_2/)
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Features**: City weather lookup, minimal design, instant results
- **Concepts**: Form handling, data lookup, user feedback

### 🕐 [Practical 3 - Digital Clock & Calendar](./practical-3/)
- **Technology**: React 19.1.1 + Vite
- **Features**: Real-time clock, dynamic greetings, timezone switching
- **Concepts**: React hooks, state management, component lifecycle

### 🔢 [Practical 4 - React Counter App](./Practical_4/)
- **Technology**: React 19.1.1 + Vite
- **Features**: Interactive counter, user forms, beautiful animations
- **Concepts**: State management, controlled components, interactive UI

## Design Philosophy

All practicals follow a consistent design language:
- **Clean & Minimal**: Simple, uncluttered interfaces
- **Light Theme**: Consistent light gray backgrounds (#f5f5f5)
- **Modern Typography**: Clean Arial fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Accessible**: Clear focus states and intuitive interactions

## Technology Progression

The practicals demonstrate a learning progression:

1. **Vanilla Web Technologies** (Practicals 1 & 2)
   - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - DOM manipulation and event handling
   - Simple state management

2. **Modern React Development** (Practicals 3 & 4)
   - React hooks and functional components
   - State management with useState
   - Side effects with useEffect
   - Modern build tools (Vite)

## Getting Started

### For Vanilla JS Practicals (1 & 2)
Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

### For React Practicals (3 & 4)
```bash
# Navigate to the practical directory
cd practical-3  # or Practical_4

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Key Learning Concepts

### Frontend Fundamentals
- HTML5 semantic structure
- CSS3 styling and layouts
- JavaScript event handling
- DOM manipulation

### React Development
- Functional components
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Component lifecycle
- Event handling in React
- Controlled components
- CSS-in-JS styling

### Modern Development
- Build tools (Vite)
- Package management (npm)
- Code linting (ESLint)
- Development servers
- Hot module replacement

## Browser Compatibility

All practicals are compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Development Timeline

Each practical builds upon the previous ones:
1. **Basic interactivity** with vanilla JavaScript
2. **Form handling** and data management
3. **React fundamentals** with hooks
4. **Advanced React** with multiple state management
